Applying Gradient descent to a simple dataset . This code is for the Code challenge hosted weekly by Siraj Raval on YouTube. The code challenge was given in the video "The Math Of Intelligence" which was basically about the gradient descent algorithm .

I just started the course of Machine learning  - by Andrew Ng provided on Coursera . Kudos to Siraj for the extraordinary work on Youtube . It has motivated me a lot to .
