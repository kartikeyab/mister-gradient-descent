# mister-gradient-descent
Applying Gradient descent to a simple dataset . This code is for the Code challenge hosted weekly by Siraj Raval on YouTube. The code challenge was given in the video "The Math Of Intelligence" which was basically about the gradient descent algorithm .

This will be my first code on Github . I wrote a very simple version for the gradient descent algorithm . My aim was to understand the algorithm , which i did . Thanks Siraj !

I just started the course of Machine learning  - by Andrew Ng provided on Coursera . Kudos to Siraj for the extraordinary work on Youtube . It has motivated me a lot  .
